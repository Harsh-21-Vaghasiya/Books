# Books

Hello everyone, and welcome to the world of books!
I made this project for students.
In situations like Corona, the studies are online, so many of the students cannot purchase books offline. So for that, I made this site in which all students can share their PDF books of notes so all students can learn.
I add functionality like adding books, deleting or updating books, or downloading the books.
Â 
I added some extra functionality, like a finder, so it would be easy to find your magical books.
